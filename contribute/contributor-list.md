## Project Lead / Creator

## LongChair

Lionel "LongChair" Chazallon deserves a special mention.

LongChair was the first community member to join the RasPlex support channel. He started out as a tester, but since then his knowledge of Git, Linux, and the XBMC / Plex core code has grown to a staggering degree. He's been responsible for many performance tweaks, and has provided a great deal of leadership to the project. While other devs have come and gone, LongChair has always been around - staying up to insane hours of the night - tweaking performance and shaving off a few seconds here and there to get the GUI to be as fast as it is.

You'll probably see LongChair on the forums, in live chat, or triaging Github Issues. If you do, make sure to thank him for all his hard work!

## RasPlex Core Team
