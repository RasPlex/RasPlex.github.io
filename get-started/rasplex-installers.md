# Stuff you should have

+ A Raspberry Pi mini computer (512MB recommended, it should have a blue analog audio jack, if it's black then it's 256MB)
+ A case to protect your Raspberry Pi (optional)
+ A 2GB or larger SD card (class 10+) with compatible reader
+ A USB micro power supply (should be at least 2A at 5v, if you experience crashing it's probably because you have a bad power supply)
+ An HDMI cord

### You will probably want

+ A remote control see [our FAQ](/docs/faq.html) for ways to control rasplex
+ A USB Wifi dongle
+ A USB Bluetooth adapter

## Reporting problems

Please kindly report any issues you encounter against the <a href="https://github.com/RasPlex/rasplex-installer/issues" target="_blank">github repo</a>

## These are betas

These installers are considered Beta software, and there are several improvements for them planned. They will handle:

+ Downloading the latest (or any selected) version of RasPlex
+ Flashing it to SD card

If these installers do not work for you, you can use our [legacy download instructions](/get-started/download-rasplex.html).

## Planned features include:

+ Ability to update an existing SD card
+ Ability to toggle SDTV or HDMI mode

## Want to help?

The installers are open source, and available on <a href="https://github.com/RasPlex/rasplex-installer" target="_blank">github</a>. Thanks Patrik for getting the ball rolling on this!
