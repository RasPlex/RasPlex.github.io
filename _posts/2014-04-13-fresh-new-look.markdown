# New paint job

We've given the website a fresh new look, finally updating our stylesheets after about a year. 

# New blog!

We've finally added a blog for RasPlex, and will be incorporating various social outlets into the blog very soon.

# New backend

You probably won't be able to tell, but we've completely changed how the website is generated. The site started out being hosted using a CMS called "modx", but to save money we replaced it with a static version of that site.

But it's a pretty big pain working with a pure static website, so we converted this output into a Jekyll site that is now almost entirely powered by markdown.

# New Content

Now that the website is much easier to manage, we've gone and updated a lot of the content. We'll be making a point of doing this much more regularly.
