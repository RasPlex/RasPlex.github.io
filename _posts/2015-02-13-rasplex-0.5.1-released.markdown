# Here are our notable changes:

* Please ensure you are using the latest updated installer
* Same codebase as 0.5.0 with some patches to fix common issues
* Huge update to linux kernel and drivers
* Raspberry Pi 2 support
* Ensure you are using the updated installer
* Menu sounds are now finally supported
* AVIO disabled by default as it was causing transcoding issues
* Fix for Motorola NYX remote to keep from flipping
* Updated linux kernel to 3.18.6
* Support for device trees, including hifiberry (you need to add dtoverlay=hifiberry to the config.txt file)
* Support for several new wireless cards
