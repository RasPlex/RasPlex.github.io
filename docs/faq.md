## How can I control RasPlex?

There are a few options here.

+ Using a USB keyboard is probably easiest. Wireless keyboards are more convenient, but make sure that the wireless transmitter doesn't draw too much power, or else use a powered hub.
+ One of the most popular ways to control RasPlex is with the official Plex Inc iOS and Android apps. Please note that the API has recently been changed by Plex Inc, so you need to use the most recent version of the app and RasPlex. You can also use the plex.tv web ui.
+ A RemotePi Board from <a href="http://www.msldigital.com" target=_blank">MSL Digital
+ A user contributed a <a href="http://errorfreeit.com.au/blog/2014/1/4/free-online-rasplex-remote" target="_blank">free RasPlex remote</a> useable from a web browser. You can get the source <a href="https://github.com/RasPlex/Simple-RasPlex-Remote" target="_blank">on github.</a>
+ All or most remote controls supported by LIRC should work plug and play. The original Xbox remote is very popular and known to be working. There are still lots of surplus units which can be obtained for about $5, but you'll need an xbox to USB adapter, or a soldering iron.
+ Many newer TVs support HDMICEC, which would allow you to use your TV's remote to control RasPlex. Please note that HDMICEC is kind of sketchy, so it won't work with all TVs, even if they say they support CEC.

## Why use Plex instead of Kodi or OpenELEC?

In short, Plex uses a Client / Server architecture that enables really thin clients, making it the perfect companion for the Raspberry pi. There are many other reasons, [detailed](/about/why-rasplex.html). Kodi and OpenELEC are great, and Rasplex uses code that is actually built on top of Kodi and OpenELEC. You can think of Plex as a superset of Kodi.

There is also a very <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5991757/should-i-use-plex-or-xbmc-for-my-home-theater-pc" target="_blank">fair, informative lifehacker article</a> about this.A

## How much does RasPlex cost

### RasPlex is free

RasPlex is and always will be free to download, use, and mod. As our [mission statement](/about/mission-statement.html) states, RasPlex fights for the users, and belongs to the community.

We encourage users to support the project by contributing ideas, code, complaints, donating, flattr'ing, etc.

## I think I found a bug or something isn't working right

Please follow our <a href="https://github.com/RasPlex/RasPlex/wiki/How-to-report-a-bug" target="_blank">bug submission guidelines</a>, keep in mind the better and more detailed your bug report is, the better chance we will be able to fix your problem. Please be patient, polite, and as helpful as you can. Remember, we are all volunteers.

## What are similar projects?

There are several other media centers for the Raspberry Pi that can offer similar functionality. They are all great projects and we recommend you give them a try. As we are relatively new to the scene, you might find these other solutions to be more stable.A

+ <a href="http://www.openelec.tv/" target="_blank"> OpenELEC </a> is a platform for XBMC that we are currently based on
+ <a href="http://xbian.org/" target="_blank"> XBian </a> is a platform for XBMC that runs on raspbian.
+ <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/" target="_blank"> Raspbmc </a>is another platform for XBMC that runs on raspbian.
+ <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Add-on:PleXBMC" target="_blank">PleXBMC</a> is a Python addon to XBMC that can be used with any of the above to provide Plex functionality on the Raspberry Pi.
+ <a href="https://github.com/dalehamel/pyplex" target="_blank">PyPlex</a> is a light weight frontend for Plex on Raspberry Pi that requires the iOS or Android app to control it.

## How can I help

Lots of ways! See [how you can help](/contribute/how-to-help.html)

## Does RasPlex run the Plex Media Server?

No.

RasPlex is designed to be a thin client for the Plex Media Server. You must have a Plex Media Server set up on PC, Mac, or Linux, or compatible NaS to get the most out of RasPlex.
While it is possible to run Plex Media Server on a Raspberry Pi, there are limitations, for example, no transcoding. Anyone who wants the client and server on the same device should just use Kodi or OpenELEC, though it is the opinion of many that the client/server separation is a much better architecture, especially for Raspberry Pi.

## Where Can I get help?

There are many places!

+ Our <a href="http://chat.srvthe.net/"> live developer chat</a> is pretty lively, with members from around the world
+ The <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/categories/rasplex/"> RasPlex forums</a> are great if you don't mind waiting

## How do I setup Wifi

We are using the same process OpenELEC uses. The config options are under "System Settings". You have to reboot to test your network configuration.

## Is AirPlay and AirTunes supported?

Thanks to Kodi there is support for AirPlay video and AirTunes. AirPlay mirroring is currently not supported. iOS 7 broke AirPlay support, but using the latest Rasplex Pre-Release versions and the latest iOS should enable AirPlay of audio only

## How do I get the latest updates?

You can select from multiple update channels in Preferences -> System -> Software update. Selecting "PreRelease" will get you the most up-to-date works in progress. Selecting "Stable" will only get you the most stable releases. You can manually update, or a new update will be downloaded once available for your chosen channel.

## Why do I need to use Pre-Caching

Pre-Caching looks through your Libraries and writes images to the SD card, when you subsequently navigate through your Libraries for the first time the cached images are used instead of Rasplex having to fetch them from the Plex server which speeds up intial navigation. You only need to run Pre-Caching if you have reflashed your SD card with a new version of Rasplex or have added a large amount of new media files to your Libraries.

### Why do I have to undertake Pre-caching after updating?

When you completely image RasPlex, you destroy the cache. However, automatic updates are designed to leave the cache, as well as settings, intact.

## How come I have a problem no one else has!

This is because you have something unique about your RasPlex setup. Usually, this means you have an odd network configuration, or a weird router. Sometimes, it's because you don't have a good USB power supply for rasplex. Other times, your SD card is faulty, or your Raspberry Pi itself is defective. In some cases, certain NaS devices running the Plex Media Server won't perform well. Ensure you are running the latest version of the media server, and if all else fails please file a bug report.

## What happened to the Kickstarter for the RasPlex case?

For various reasons (Dale changing jobs, moving, delays getting Kickstarter in Canada, etc) the project has been cancelled. The STL and solidworks files are available on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rasplex/files/case/" target="_blank">sourceforge</a>, and you can purchase 3D printed models from <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/rasplex" target="_blank">Shapeways</a> if you choose. If you made a large donation and expected to receive a case, please email us and we'll work something out for you.</div>
