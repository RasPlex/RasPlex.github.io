      <p><a href="https://plex.tv">Plex Media Server</a> is required to be installed on your home computer in order to use RasPlex.</p>
      <p>It will organize your media on your computer for you, automatically get stuff like Movie posters, actors, episode descrptions - you name it! While you're at it, set up some plex channels and a myPlex account. </p>
      <p>It is closed source, but free to use. Please consider <a href="https://plex.tv/subscription" target="_blank"> purchasing a PlexPass </a> to support <a href="https://plex.tv" target="_blank"> Plex Inc</a>.</p>

      <a href="/get-started/rasplex-installers.html" target="_blank"><img class="oslogo" src="/images/getrasplex.png" alt="" /></a>
      <p>Follow the steps to <a href="/get-started/rasplex-installers.html">get RasPlex</a>, and set up a RasPlex box on every TV in your home. At the meager cost of a Raspberry Pi, why not get some for your friends and family to share all of your media!</p>
      <p><strong>Please note:</strong> the first run of RasPlex will always be the slowest, and RasPlex performs better on 1024Mb (Model B2) Raspberry Pi's than on 512MB (Model B and B+). To speed things up, you should run pre-caching as described in <a href="faq.html">the FAQ</a></p>
