          <h2>RasPlex fights for the Users</h2>
          <div class="offset1">
            <p>RasPlex will be the best, cheapest, and most accessible client for Plex Media Server.</p>
            <p>It is absolutely critical to also to keep the project community driven, free to download and use, and completely open source. The community has nurtured RasPlex to where it is today, RasPlex <strong> belongs to your</strong>.</p>
          </div>
          <h2>RasPlex means business</h2>
          <div class="offset1">
            <p>By supporting RasPlex with donations, or by purchasing a heavily discounted case and preflahed SD card (once they become available), you are investing in improving RasPlex. Your contribution goes towards fixing bugs and adding features.</p>
            <p>Funds are used for hardware expenses, as "bounty" for developers, and to pay various bills.</p>
            <p>The RasPlex case that is in the final stages of prototyping will be the basis for a revenue stream for RasPlex, though it is our goal to sell it for as cheap as the manufacturing process will allow us to.</p>
            <p>We want RasPlex to be used everywhere, on every TV.</p>
          </div>
          <h2>Use it, Fix it, Change it, Upgrade it</h2>
          <div class="offset1">
            <p>RasPlex is meant to be modded, tweaked, customized, and improved. We even have plans to include Emulation Station, so that RasPlex will be a full fledged home entertainment center with support for emulating retro game consoles.</p>
          </div>
          <h2>RasPlex everywhere</h2>
          <div class="offset1">
            <p>All funds taken in are reinvested in RasPlex - Dale takes nothing out (and in fact pays a lot of the expenses out of pocket). I want to see how big it can get. I want it everywhere. I want everyone using RasPlex to turn every TV in their house into a Smart TV, and to have their media, their way.</p>
            <p>I want to kill AppleTV. RasPlex is already a superset of XBMC functionality, and once it has fully matured, it should be comparable to the Roku in terms of features and price, only with a much nicer GUI, and completely FOSS. </p>

            <p>We built RasPlex for you, so try it today. Post on our forums. Drop by our chat. Fork us on github. Help us see how far this project can go, and how big it can get. </p>
            <p>Thank you for your support,</p>
