## RasPlex fights for the Users

RasPlex will be the best, cheapest, and most accessible client for Plex Media Server.

It is absolutely critical to also to keep the project community driven, free to download and use, and completely open source. The community has nurtured RasPlex to where it is today, RasPlexÂ **belongs to you!**

## RasPlex means business

By supporting RasPlex with donations, or by purchasing a heavily discounted case and preflahed SD card (once they become available), you are investing in improving RasPlex. Your contribution goes towards fixing bugs and adding features.

Funds are used for hardware expenses, as "bounty" for developers, and to pay various bills.

The RasPlex case that is in the final stages of prototyping will be the basis for a revenue stream for RasPlex, though it is our goal to sell it for as cheap as the manufacturing process will allow us to.

We want RasPlex to be used everywhere, on every TV.

## RasPlex everywhere

All funds taken in are reinvested in RasPlex - Dale takes nothing out (and in fact pays a lot of the expenses out of pocket). I want to see how big it can get. I want it everywhere. I want everyone using RasPlex to turn every TV in their house into a Smart TV, and to have their media, their way.

I want to kill AppleTV. RasPlex is already a superset of XBMC functionality, and once it has fully matured, it should be comparable to the Roku in terms of features and price, only with a much nicer GUI, and completely FOSS.

Queue world domination music.
